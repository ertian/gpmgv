<h3>Arguments</h3>
<dl>
<dt>sweep
<dd>A sweep structure.
<p>
<dt>radar_header
<dd>Radar header structure. Provides time stamp and radar location.
</dl>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<dl>
<dt>ABOUT_FIELD
<dd>A string containing information about the field which will appear in TITLE.
This replaces the default field information, which is simply the field type
(DZ, VR, . . .).
<p>
<dt>LIKE_FIELD
<dd>A string naming the field type whose color table and value scaling is to be
used to plot this data. This keyword is needed only if the field
type is not one of those recognized by rsl_plotsweep.
Recognized field types are DZ, CZ, ZT, VR, SW, DR, ZD, KD, PH, and RH.
<p>
<dt>MAXRANGE
<dd>Maximum range to be plotted, in kilometers.  Default is 220 km
unless the radar site is Kwajalein, in which case it is 200.
<p>
<dt>NEW_WINDOW
<dd>Set this to open a new plot window.
<p>
<dt>TITLE
<dd>Title to appear above plot.  Default is the site name followed
by date and time of scan, the field type, and the elevation
angle in degrees.
<p>
<dt>WINDOWSIZE
<dd>Window size in pixels.  WINDOWSIZE may be scalar or a 2 element array.
If scalar, it specifies both width and height of the window.  If an array,
the first element is width and the second is height.
<p>
<dt>ADVANCE
<dd>This keyword is passed to IDL's MAP_SET procedure.  When set,
and !P.MULTI is set, IDL advances to the next plot position
in a multiple plots window.
<p>
<dt>AZIM_SPOKES
<dd>The interval in degrees between azimuth spokes.
The default is 30 degrees. To prevent display of azimuth spokes, set
AZIM_SPOKES to zero.
<p>
<dt>RANGE_AZIM_SPOKES
<dd>Range in kilometers for azimuth spokes, i.e., the range at which each
spoke ends.  Default is the range of the outermost range ring.
<p>
<dt>RANGE_RING_INTERVAL
<dd>The interval between range rings, in kilometers. Default is
50 km. Set this keyword to zero to turn off range ring display.
<p>
<dt>CHARSIZE
<dd>IDL graphics keyword used to set the character size for axes titles and
annotations.  Normal size is 1.0, which is the default.
<p>
<dt>BGWHITE
<dd>Set this for white background.  Default is black.
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>
Plot the first sweep of the second field in the radar structure, using a white
background for the image.

<code>rsl_plotsweep, radar.volume[1].sweep[0], radar.h, /bgwhite</code>
