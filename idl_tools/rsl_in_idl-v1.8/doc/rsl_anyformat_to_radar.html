<h3>Return Value</h3>
If successful, or KEEP_RADAR is set, the function returns a radar structure.
Otherwise, it returns an integer value of -1.
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<dl>
<dt>radarfile
<dd>A string containing name of radar file. Gzipped files are automatically
uncompressed.
<p>
<dt>siteID_or_header
<dd>For WSR-88D only.  It is a string containing
either the 4-character site ID or the name of a WSR-88D header file.
If omitted, program will attempt to get site ID from file name.
</dl>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<dl>
<dt>CATCH_ERROR
<dd>Starting with version 1.4, this keyword is set by default.  Setting it
causes control to return to the calling program in the event of an error.
Set CATCH_ERROR to 0 to cause IDL to stop where the error occurred.
<p>
<dt>KEEP_RADAR
<dd>Set this keyword to return the radar structure if an error
occurs. By default, -1 is returned in the event of an error.
<p>
<dt>KEEP_SAILS
<dd>Set this keyword to keep the additional low-level split cut inserted in the middle of volume scan in VCPs 12 and 212 (WSR-88D) when SAILS is in effect. By default, this is removed.
<p>
<dt>ERROR
<dd>Set this keyword to a variable to return the error status. A value of 1 is
returned for error, 0 otherwise.
<p>
<dt>FIELDS
<dd>String array containing names of the fields to read.  Default is to read
all fields.  For UF and Sigmet raw files, fields are in the form of the
2-character names used by RSL and UF, such as 'DZ', 'VR', etc. For CfRadial,
the field names are the data variable names as stored in the CfRadial file.
(Note: This keyword is not in effect for WSR-88D Level 2 data.)
<p>
<dt>MAXSWEEPS
<dd>Maximum number of sweeps to read from volume scan. Default: all sweeps.
Note: This keyword applies only to CfRadial, UF, and Sigmet raw files.
<p>
<dt>QUIET
<dd>Set this keyword to turn off progress reporting.
<p>
<dt>VOS_NUMBER
<dd>Only For TSDIS 1B-51 and 1C-51 HDF. Set this to the number of the volume
scan (1 to n) to be read from the TSDIS HDF. Default is the first volume scan.
