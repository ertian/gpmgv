<h2>rsl_radar_to_cfradial</h2>
 
<pre>
 This procedure writes data from the radar structure to a file in CfRadial format.

 Syntax:
     rsl_radar_to_cfradial, radar [, cfradfile] [, FIELDS=fields] [, /GZIP],
         [, /DAT1D] [, /DAT2D]

 Arguments:
     radar:     a Radar data structure.
     cfradfile: an optional argument containing the name of the CfRadial file.
         If the the file name ends in '.gz', the file is compressed with
         'gzip'.  If this argument is omitted, a file name is constructed in
         the form: cfrad.SITE_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.nc.

 Keywords:
     FIELDS:
         String array containing the fields to be written to the output
         file.  Default is all fields.  Fields are in the form of the
         two-character field names used by RSL, such as 'DZ', 'VR', etc.
     DAT1D:
         Set this keyword to store data fields into CfRadial in 1-D arrays.  By
         default, function determines appropriate dimensions.
     DAT2D:
         Set this keyword to store data fields into CfRadial in 2-D arrays.  By
         default, function determines appropriate dimensions.
     GZIP: 
         Set this keyword to compress the CfRadial file with 'gzip'.
