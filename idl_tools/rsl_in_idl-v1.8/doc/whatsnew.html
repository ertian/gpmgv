<h2>What's New in RSL in IDL</h2>
<h3>Version 1.8, released May 10, 2017</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Handles WSR-88D files with internal bzip2 compression.
    <li>Handles Olympex campaign data.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7, released July 20, 2015</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes WSR-88D MESO-SAILS sweeps. This action can be turned off by
    setting the keyword KEEP_SAILS when calling rsl_anyformat_to_radar.
    <li>Added keyword DAT2D to rsl_radar_to_cfradial. Set it to store data in
    CfRadial in 2-D array. Default is 1-D array.
    <li> Added FIXED_ANGLE to sweep header. Fixed angle may be either elevation
    or azimuth angle, depending on scan mode.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6, released October 20, 2014</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Writes to CfRadial.  See <a href="rsl_radar_to_cfradial.html">rsl_radar_to_cfradial</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.5, released August 4, 2014</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Reads CfRadial. (Write CfRadial is in development.)
    <li>Removes the low-level split cut inserted in the middle of
    volume scan in VCPs 12 and 212 (WSR-88D) when SAILS is in effect.
    To keep this additional split cut, set keyword KEEP_SAILS.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4, released September 10, 2011</h3>
<ul>
    <li>WSR-88D Build 12 now supported, including polarimetric fields.
    <li>New keywords for <a href="rsl_plotsweep.html">rsl_plotsweep</a>:
    <ul>
        <li>AZIM_SPOKES: Interval in degrees for azimuth spokes.<br>
        <li>RANGE_RING_INTERVAL: Interval in km between range rings.<br>
        <li>RANGE_AZIM_SPOKES: Range in km for azimuth spokes.<br>
    </ul>
    <li>A slight change in the install procedure:<br>
    In previous versions, installing consisted simply of untarring the tar
    file.  It was easy, but also made it easy to overwrite existing files,
    which may not be what was wanted. To avoid this problem, the name of the
    directory in the tar file now includes the software version number.  A
    script named 'rslinstall' is used to copy the programs to the target
    directory.  See <a href="Install.html"> Installing</a> for details.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3, released October 10, 2008</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added VCP (Volume Coverage Pattern) to radar header for WSR-88D.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2, released September 5, 2008</h3>
<ul>
    <li>RSL in IDL now supports WSR-88D Level II Build 10.
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1, released December 20, 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routines to convert range and elevation to/from ground range and
height:<br>
<a href="rsl_get_groundr_and_h.html">rsl_get_groundr_and_h</a><br>
<a href="rsl_get_gr_slantr_h.html">rsl_get_gr_slantr_h</a><br>
<a href="rsl_get_slantr_and_elev.html">rsl_get_slantr_and_elev</a><br>
<a href="rsl_get_slantr_and_h.html">rsl_get_slantr_and_h</a><br>
<li><a href="rsl_select_sweeps.html">rsl_select_sweeps</a>: Returns a radar
structure containing only the sweeps selected.
</ul>
